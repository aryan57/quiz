All nations should promote the regeneration of degraded forest lands to increase permanent forest cover, reduce pressure on natural forest, conserve biodiversity, protect water sheds and soils and stabilize climax. There should be a concerted effort to prevent encroachment pressures by providing land security to small and landless farmers through land tenure law, land reform or agarian reform. There should be proper modification in the development schemes (i.e., mining, hydroelectric, road building, plantation etc.) to minimise their direct and indirect impacts on natural forests. Over grazing in forest areas should be regulated by government. </p>

 There should be efforts to relieve pressure on forests by decreasing waste in wood processing, increasing the efficiency of wood burning stoves and seeking alternative raw materials. Ecological stability should receive precedence over the economic stability in the matter of forest growth Efforts should be made to involve local people, NGOs and forest department in developing degraded forest lands as well as conserving the existing forests. </p>

There should be effort to encourage sustainable forest management in order to maintain ecological balance.Public awareness should be created against the hazards of deforestation.Forest should be honoured not as a source of revenue but as a global asset to be protected for the well being of the globe.In view of the vital importance of the forest in maintaining ecological balance and preserving biophysical system of the environment, the Government of India has revised the old forest policy of 1952 in 1988.</p>
